# itcs3162-projects
This repository contains multiple data analysis and machine learning projects completed using Jupyter Notebook. The projects cover various data-driven tasks, including clustering, data cleaning, association rules, and exploratory data analysis, with practical implementations on real-world datasets such as Spotify, housing prices, and health insurance. Each notebook is well-documented to provide clear insights into the steps followed and the outcomes achieved.
